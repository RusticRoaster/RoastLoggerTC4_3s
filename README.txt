RoastLoggerTC4
--------------

RoastLoggerTC4  version 2.0    10 July 2012 by Jim Gallt and Tom Coxon
 - general release of software with standalone capability (see below)
 - default fan PWM frequency set to 61Hz for best performance with HTC interface

RoastLoggerTC4  version 1.0b   18 May 2012 by Jim Gallt and Tom Coxon (beta version)
 - optional standalone capability includes heat, fan control with 4-button interface (LCDapter)
   - button 1:  reset timer or return to normal run mode from adjustment mode
   - button 2:  enter output level adjustment mode
   - button 3:  [up]
   - button 4:  [down]
 - "load" command rec'd from RoastLogger now resets the timer on the LCD display
 - some optimization for serial port performance


RoastLogger TC4 version 0.8    12 May 2012 by Jim Gallt
 - default PWM time base is 4 sec for heater
 - additional options provided for PWM time base for heater and fan
 - turn heater and fan off by default at program start
 - allow mapping of physical ADC channels (0-3) to logical channels (1-4)
 - round output values for heater, fan to nearest 5%
 - now supports LCDapter if attached
 - enabled use of buttons on LCDapter in (only) standalone mode:
     button 1: bean load (resets timer, turns on LED 1)
     button 2: first crack (turns on LED 2)
     button 3: second crack (turns on LED 3)
     button 4: eject (turns off all LED's)
 - increased damping on ambient temperature values to reduce noise


RoastLoggerTC4 version 0.7  25 April 2012 by Jim Gallt
  - jumper selectable temperature scale (default is Celsius)
  - ANLG2 port on TC4:   +5V    AN1    GND
                                 |______|
                           add jumper for Fahrenheit

RoastLoggerTC4 version 0.6  3 April 2012 by GreenBean
  - Minor modification to change order of output in logger method

RoastLoggerTC4 version 0.5  12 March 2012 by Jim Gallt
 - modified to allow use of different thermocouple types on each of 2 inputs
 - modified to support use of simple PWM on TC4 OT1 and IO3
    - OT1 is 1 Hz PWM intended to drive zero cross SSR for heater control
    - IO3 is 490 Hz PWM intended to control a DC fan through Darlington transistor
 - eliminated unused code for LCD display control

TC4 Arduino sketch for use with Roast Logger by GreenBean http://www.toomuchcoffee.com/
For information on the RoastLogger see:

	http://homepage.ntlworld.com/green_bean/coffee/roastlogger/roastlogger.htm

Based on the following sketch and libraries:

aBourbon.pde
-------------

This program descends from Bill Welch's original a_logger file, but
has been modified to output the following information on the serial interface:

 ambient temperature
 channel 0 temperature
 channel 0 rate of rise
 channel 1 temperature
 channel 1 rate of rise

This program outputs a series of records on the serial port:

  timestamp, ambient, temp. channel 0, rise rate channel 0, temp. 1, rise 1

This is the arduino half of the application, and can be used standalone when connected
to a 16 x 2 LCD.

The Processing half of the application, which is the PC software to plot
the realtime graphs, is pBourbon.pde

A standard parallel LCD may be used.  Or, the LCDapter board may be used.  If the
LCDapter board is used, then the four buttons on the LCDapter can be pushed with these
results:

Button 1 pressed:  "# STRT,xxx.x" string (without quotes) is written to serial
                   port, and LED 1 turns on and remains on (xxx.x = timestamp)

Button 2 pressed:  "# FC,xxx.x" string is written, and LED 2 turns on and remains on

Button 3 pressed:  "# SC,xxx.x" string is written, and LED 3 turns on and remains on

Button 4 pressed:  "# EJCT,xxx.x" string is written, and all LED's are turned off.

To implement these special features, the TC4 must be connected using a 4-wire
I2C interface to an LCDapter board.  Use the LCDAPTER define in user.h.

The 64K EEPROM on the TC4 is supported by aBourbon.  Use the "EEPROM_BRBN" define
in user.h to enable/disable this option.  Calibration information can optionally
be read from the EEPROM.

Either Fahrenheit or Celsius temperatures can be selected.  F is the default.  To
implement C, use the CELSIUS define in user.h.

Version 2.20
------------
Modified so that a dummy value for "power" output is no longer printed after the
temperature data.

Version 2.30
------------
Added stronger error checking for reading calibration data from EEPROM.  Added
support for type J and type T thermocouples.

version 3.00
------------
Arduino 1.0 compatibility
Allows termination of strings from serial to be either LF, or CR-LF.
Reset command is not case-sensitive
Supports mapping of the physical input channels to logical channels
Fixed overflow problem which shows up in timer after 9 hours
Different button behavior in standalone mode (left button press resets timer)
Prints note on serial and LCD if EEPROM values are missing.
Longer startup delay (500ms) to avoid stuttering starts
